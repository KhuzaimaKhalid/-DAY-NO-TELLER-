# DAY NO TELLER 
Description
The Day No Teller is a simple C program that converts a numeric input (1-7) into the corresponding day of the week. The program uses a switch statement to determine which day to display based on the user's input.

Features
Prompts the user to enter a number corresponding to a day of the week.
Uses a switch statement to map numbers 1 through 7 to their respective days (Monday to Sunday).
Provides feedback for invalid inputs outside the range of 1 to 7.
How It Works
The program starts by displaying a welcome message.
It prompts the user to enter a number representing a day of the week.
The program reads the input and uses a switch statement to determine the corresponding day:
If the input is 1, it prints "Monday."
If the input is 2, it prints "Tuesday."
If the input is 3, it prints "Wednesday."
If the input is 4, it prints "Thursday."
If the input is 5, it prints "Friday."
If the input is 6, it prints "Saturday."
If the input is 7, it prints "Sunday."
If the input is not between 1 and 7, it prints "not a valid day."
